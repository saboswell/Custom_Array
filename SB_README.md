Planning on using Custom Array for 90K chip

Suggested by custom array: 

SP6 truncated promoter - insert - BsrDI sequence
GAAGCGAGGATCAACT_insert_region_CATTGCGTGAACCGA

Amplify with custom array defaults

CATACGATTTAGGTGACACTATAGAAGCGAGGATCAACT: Sp6 truncated promoter
GAGCTTCGGTTCACGCAATG: Rev+BsrDI sequence 


WANT to be able to amplify pools of 
1) ERCC_list
2) c_genes
3) galaxy_Neg600
4) sequence_filtered_1-200 (2 files)
5) sequence_filtered_201-450 (2 files)
6) sequence_filtered_451-700 (2 files)

Want to be able to amplify each of thse pools and add on the rest of the SP6 promoter or could use a T7 promoter.
I'd appreicate your advice on how best to accomplish this!
